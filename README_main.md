# User Guide

## Requirements

- Python >= 3.10
- OS: Ubuntu, MacOS, Windows

## Installation

Pip installing the package from PyPI is not yet available. Instead, download [from this link](https://github.com/oedokumaci/template-python/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and unzip. You will also need to change the folder name from template-python-main to template-python (or cd into template-python-main in step 2 below). Alternatively, if you have git installed, simply run 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/oedokumaci/template-python
```
to install the package locally. After downloading, here are the steps to install the dependencies in a virtual environment using [PDM]:

1. `pip install pdm`
2. `cd template-python`
3. `pdm install --prod`

## Usage

### Configuration

First edit the `./config/config.yaml` to your liking. Example config files can be found at `./config/`.

### Quick Start

After configuring the `./config/config.yaml`, simply run the following command in the project directory.
```bash
pdm run python -m template_python
```

### Detailed Usage
For a list of all the CLI arguments and options, run
```bash
pdm run python -m template_python --help
```

# Developer Guide

## Makefile
There is a Makefile in the project directory. You can run `make help` to see the available commands as below. The Makefile is also used in the CI/CD pipeline.

## Setup

This project is [PDM]-managed, which is compatible with [PEP 621](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0621) (also compatible with the <i>rejected</i> [PEP 582](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0582)). If you are a developer, first `pip install pdm` and then `git clone` the project. Next you can `pdm install` in the project directory, which will install all the dependencies in a [virtual environment](https://pdm.fming.dev/latest/usage/venv/).

## Development

### Pre-commit Hooks

The project also uses pre-commit hooks. Because the project uses [PDM], you **do not** need to `pip install pre-commit`. Instead, run directly
```bash
pdm run pre-commit install
```
in the project directory to install hooks to your local `.git`. Alternatively, you can also activate the virtual environment and run
```bash
pre-commit install
```
